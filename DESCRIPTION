Title: Tools for HLA Data
Version: 0.1.2
Description: A streamlined tool for eplet analysis of donor and recipient HLA (human leukocyte antigen) mismatch. Messy, low-resolution HLA typing data is cleaned, and imputed to high-resolution using the NMDP (National Marrow Donor Program) haplotype reference database <https://haplostats.org/haplostats>. High resolution data is analyzed for overall or single antigen eplet mismatch using a reference table (currently supporting 'HLAMatchMaker' <http://www.epitopes.net> versions 2 and 3). Data can enter or exit the workflow at different points depending on the user's aims and initial data quality.
