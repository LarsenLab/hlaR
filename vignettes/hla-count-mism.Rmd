count mis-match hla based on the input vector of allele names

@jz query should we add dependency on readr and use read_csv
I used here but we can probably avoid this

```{r}
library(hlaR)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

```{r}
hla_mm_cnt <- read_csv(here("inst", "extdata", "HLA_MisMatch_count_test.csv"))
```

@jz Query =======
can functions load with library? - yes
can we have output append to the original df as option? or have id from original df with the classI output?

```{r}

# source(here("R/hla-count-mism.R"))

classI <- CountMism(hla_mm_cnt, c("mism.a1", "mism.a2", "mism.b1", "mism.b2"))

```
