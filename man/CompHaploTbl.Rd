\title{compare alleles with NMDP frequency table to get top combination of haplotypes based on user cutoffs}
\usage{
CompHaploTbl(dat_in, cut_p, cut_n)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat_in}{dataframe with recipient/donor alleles info}

\item{cut_p}{cutoff frequence value of the population, it's passed to FuncForCompHaplo()}

\item{cut_n}{cutoff number of how many top combinations will be kept in the final table, it's passed to FuncForCompHaplo()}
}
\value{
a list of dataframe of most matched allele combination of each subject
}

\dontrun{
result <- CompHaploTbl(dat_in = dat, cut_p= 0.0001, cut_n = 10)
