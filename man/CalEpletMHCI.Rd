\title{Calculate class I MHC eplet mismatch.}
\usage{
CalEpletMHCI(dat_in, ver = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat_in}{A dataframe with subject info(pair_id and subject_type) and both copies of each copy of HLA A, B, and C.
Each unique participant id has 2 rows associated with it, 1 for recipient, 1 for donor.}

\item{ver}{Version number of MatchMaker based eplet reference table to use. Mismatch calculation logic are based on MatchMaker too.}
}
\value{
A list of data tables.
single_detail: single molecule level class I MHC eplet mismatch table, including mismatch eplet name and total count of each allele.
overall_count: original input data appended with total count of mismatched eplet.
overall_detail: percentage of mismatch across all subject of each eplet.
